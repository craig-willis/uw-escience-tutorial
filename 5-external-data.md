# Managing External Data

In this lesson we'll take a closer look at how external data is managed in Whole Tale.

Questions:
* What is "external data"?
* What is a research data repository?
* What is a digital object identifier?
* How do I register external data?

Objectives:
* Learn about research repositories
* Learn about data citation
* Learn which repositories are currently supported

## Research data repositories

As a researcher you are likely already familiar with research data repositories. Many publishers now require that data (and increasingly code) associated with published research be published in discipline-specific or general repositories. Many instutions also run local institutional data repositories. 

For example, Nature's [Recommended Data Repositories](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories). Popular general repositories include Harvard's Dataverse, Figshare, Zenodo, and Dryad.

Question:
* What is the difference between a research data repository and source code repositories such as Github. 

## Digital Object Identifiers (DOI)

A digital object identifier (DOI) is a resolvable persistent identifier commonly used in the web-based publication of scholarly articles and research datasets. DOI are a central part of the data citation model -- ensuring that researchers get proper attribution/credit for published datasets.

## External Data in Whole Tale

Whole Tale allows you to register data from external repositories for use in your tales. This serves two purposes: 1) to create an explicit link (citation) between your tale and data used and 2) to prevent making multiple copies of published research datasets.  Currently, Whole Tale supports [DataONE Network member nodes](https://www.dataone.org/current-member-nodes), [Dataverse Network members](https://services.dataverse.harvard.edu/miniverse/map/), and the Materials Data Facility. 

## Activity: Register an external dataset

* Select "Manage" > "Data" > "+" button. This opens the register window
* Enter the URI or DOI for a dataset. If you don't have one, use https://doi.org/10.5065/d6862dm8.
* Select "Search" then "Register"

What's happening:
* Whole Tale registers the dataset if it doesn't already exist and adds it to your list of registered datasets
* This is a "metadata only" operation -- the files (bytes) aren't transferred until they are accessed (opened)

## Activity: Add the data to your tale
* Select "Run" > Tale > Files > External Data > "+" button
* Under "My Data" select the dataset, a subfolder or file, then "Add Selected" and "Select"
* Select "Interact" then browse to the "data" directory in your running environment
* Select "Metadata" and note the "Datasets used"

## Key points:
* Whole Tale allows you to register and add external data to your tales to prevent duplication of data and ensure proper attribution.
