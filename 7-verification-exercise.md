#  Exercise: Verifying Published Research

Let's take a real-world example and look at what it takes to verify computational reproducibility of someone else's work.

The file [compendium.zip](https://github.com/craig-willis/uw-escience-tutorial/raw/master/compendium.zip) contains the following replication package:

> Lelkes, Yphtach; Sood, Gaurav; Iyengar, Shanto, 2015, "Replication Data for: The Hostile Audience: The Effect of Access to Broadband Internet on Partisan Affect", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/W1YJZQ, Harvard Dataverse, V1

* Read the `readme.txt`
* Download and extract the [compendium.zip](https://github.com/craig-willis/uw-escience-tutorial/raw/master/compendium.zip)
* Download the [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.122370) associated with this dataset
* Start an RStudio instance in Whole Tale
* Try to reproduce the Figure 1 and Table 1

Questions:
* Were you able to reproduce the the figure and table in the paper?
* What version of R was used to create this package?
* What other libraries?
* How would you organize this to make it easier to understand?
* What is the source of the data used in the map?
